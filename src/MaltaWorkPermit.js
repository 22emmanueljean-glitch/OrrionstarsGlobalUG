                Malta has a growing economy that has managed to withstand economic downturns while maintaining a low unemployment rate in comparison to other EU nations. The Maltese government expends significant effort and resources to maintain this number as low as possible, with unemployment estimated at 6.5% in June 2010. Malta draws a significant number of international workers, particularly in the online gaming, financial, IT, and tourist sectors, due to the size of the English-speaking community and the warm climate. In Malta, the services industry employs 75% of the workforce, while manufacturing employs 22% and agriculture employs 3%.

                It should come as no surprise that moving to Malta and getting work would necessitate certain paperwork. Malta, fortunately, is one of the easiest nations to migrate to due to its openness to foreigners. In fact, moving to Malta can be as simple as booking a flight ticket depending on your country of origin.

                  <p style={{ fontFamily: typography.body.fontFamily, lineHeight: '1.7' }}>
                    Malta is a small independent nation-state in Europe, located at the center of the Mediterranean Sea. Consisting of three islands: main island Malta, Gozo, and Comino, Malta is the EU's smallest member state both in terms of landmass (316 kmÂ² / 122 sqm) and population size (516,100 in 2020).

                  <p style={{ fontFamily: typography.body.fontFamily, lineHeight: '1.7' }}>
                    Malta is 10% less expensive than the United States, while rentals are 35% lower, according to the website Numbeo. Consumer prices are also 12% lower than in the UK, with average rentals nearly a quarter lower. If you make a good living and don't overextend yourself on rent, you'll have more disposable income than if you lived in a major city like London or Paris.

                  <p style={{ fontFamily: typography.body.fontFamily, lineHeight: '1.7' }}>
                    In 2021, the unemployment rate in Malta dropped by 0.8 percentage points compared to the previous year. As a result, in 2021 Malta had the lowest unemployment rate in the entire Euro Zone. After analyzing Malta, the IMF estimated that the country's economic growth in 2021 and the next few years will be higher than the Euro Zone average.

                    Expats and those planning a migration to Malta will be relieved to know that the country is now officially bilingual. The country has two official languages, Maltese and English, and the majority of the people speak both. Since the island was a former British colony, the Maltese people had been using English for centuries, both in their daily life and in administration.

                    The Maltese are a proud people with a distinct culture that has been shaped by foreign civilizations through many centuries of occupancy. Maltese people are welcoming and friendly. The younger generation, who have traveled more and benefited from an infusion of foreign companies and people from all over the world, appear to be pleased with their country's rising status and economic progress.

                    One of the major highlights of living in Malta is how safe you feel. While small crimes can occur, they are uncommon and may typically be avoided by using common sense. Violent crime is significantly less common than in other European nations, and it is safe to walk around almost any place. People here watch out for one another, and there is still a strong sense of 'community spirit,' which helps to keep crime rates low.
